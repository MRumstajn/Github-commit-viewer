# GitHub Commit Viewer

## About

This app is a custom GitHub client that allows you to view details about a commit 
in a public GitHub repository. 

⚠ This app uses the public GitHub API. Due to the API being rate limited to 
60 HTTP requests per hour for unauthenticated applications, the app can only perform a limited 
amount of requests in unauthenticated mode. TO increase the number of requests supply a personal access token. ⚠

 - Select the repo permission group
 - Scroll down and generate the token
 - Copy the token and save it somewhere (DO NOT LOSE IT as it cannot be revealed to you again)

# GitHub Commit Viewer

This app is a custom GitHub client that allows you to view details about a commit 
in a public GitHub repository. 

⚠ This app uses the public GitHub API. Due to the API being rate limited to 
60 HTTP requests per hour for unauthenticated applications, the app can only perform a limited 
amount of requests. Use the available resources wisely :) ⚠
